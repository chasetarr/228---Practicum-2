## Practicum 2: Measurement Strategy 

### **Outcome 4**: Increase community support and knowledge of the restoration program 

#### Measurement Goal & Measure

**Goal**: Assess the level of knowledge about the SRB restoration program over time.

â€œWhich of the following SRB restoration activities is the most important for rebuilding salmon and steelhead populations?"

a. Removal of invasive riparian vegetation
b. Increasing law enforcement to curb illegal fishing
c. Removal of barriers to restore aquatic habitat connectivity
d. Addition of naturally derived nutrients
